## Features in Version 1.0.0
- **Copper Lamp** -- It functions like an inverted redstone lamp, giving a light level of 15 unless powered by redstone. It can be oxidized and waxed like any other copper block.

## Features in Version 2.0.0
- **Copper on a Stick** -- It's like a torch, except you put copper on the end of a stick. Place this on a lightning rod.
- **Copper Torch** -- The heat of a lightning strike permanently transforms "copper on a stick" into a copper torch. The electrical energy then emits from the torch into energy-storing blocks above it. This energy is compatible with Tech Reborn (1 energy per 20 ticks), albeit insignificant due to the small number.
- **Copper Capacitor Block** -- Consumes 1-10 energy every 20 ticks to shock entities in the world, similar to a magma block. Damage can be avoided by wearing leather boots. This will have the same effects as lightning would have on the entity -- so villagers will convert to witches for example.
