## Dependencies
* **Version 1.0.0+** Fabric API
* **Version 2.0.0** Reborn Energy API  2.1.0

## Features in Version 1.0.0
- **Copper Lamp** -- It functions like an inverted redstone lamp, giving a light level of 15 unless powered by redstone. It can be oxidized and waxed like any other copper block.


## Work in Progress Features for Version 2.0.0
- **Copper on a Stick** -- It's like a torch, except you put copper on the end of a stick. Place this on a lightning rod.
- **Copper Torch** -- The heat of a lightning strike permanently transforms "copper on a stick" into a copper torch. The electrical energy then emits from the torch into energy-storing blocks above it.
- **Powered Copper Block** -- Consumes 1-10 energy every 20 ticks to shock entities in the world, similar to a magma block. Damage can be avoided by wearing leather boots.
